              I have spent near a decade in retail customer service work, and
              most of that has been as some type of manager. It started as night
              manager of a little cafe while I was sitll in highschool, and just
              exploded from there. Currently I am one of the youngest Retail
              Store Managers in the state. I manage of a mid-volume state liquor
              store. My particular store is busier in the summer time than it is
              in the winter. Mostly because we get a lot of the traffic from the
              beach due to our location.We are the store that is directly
              between the most used exit and entry for the beach from the back
              roads. The rest of the year other than the townie traffic we get
              some of the people coming off of Route 1.

              I spend what little free time I actually have doing leisurely
              activities. Mostly reading, knitting or hiking. I started knitting
              when I was about eight years old and my grandmother needed
              somethng to keep me entertainded after school one day. I've
              managed to knit a few sweaters in the last few years. One most
              notably in just about two weeks over this last summer. I usually
              have my nose buried in some sort of text, usually a sci-fi or
              fantasy novel. I try to devote time every summer to read through
              the Harry Potter series at least once, and have actually managed
              to do it twice these last few years.

              I'm probably best known everywhere as having some sort of color to
              my hair. I started at the age of ten with just hight-lights and
              have been hooked ever since. I think that the only color that my
              hair has not been is yellow. I've spent a little time as orange
              just by accident. My favorite hair color to have and the one that
              most people realize how they know me by is blue. In fact my hair
              is blue on my ID currently as well.
